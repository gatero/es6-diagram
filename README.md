Simple ECMAScript 6 features diagram

I created this repo becouse I want to start learning ECMAScript 6 features. There are ofcourse a lot of resources on the Internet with this topic and some of them I write below

1. [Understanding ECMAScript 6 by Nicholas C. Zakas](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6)
2. https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features - nice overview of ECMAScript 6 features
3. http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proposals
4. http://tc39wiki.calculist.org/es6/
5. [You Don't Know JS: ES6 & Beyond](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/es6%20%26%20beyond)

But for better learning proces I like to have the ability to print some overview about topic in readable form. So for now I prepare a diagram for ES6.
